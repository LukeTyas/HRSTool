Still to do (starting to be historical);

- Write more documentation

- Create a tarball with reference frames.

- Create a script that will configure correct directory names when installing
  reference frames.

- Error handling: the python error output is very useful, but maybe could be
  reduced a bit to not confuse the end user. The backtrace maybe should be
  assigned a lower log-level than the actual error. (but then it cannot be
  recovered!)

FIEStool-1.3.2.1
================

(25/08/11)

- Minor update that deals correctly with the version of dependencies. Previous
  versions choke with PyRAF >= 1.10, for example.
- Also, adds the "bpm" parameter for fits1d, which prevents errors with newer
  IRAF versions.

FIEStool-1.3.2
==============

(27/07/09)

- Added a detailed COPYRIGHT statement to the distribution. In addition, all
  distributed (text-based) files include a copyright header.

(24/07/09)

- Added FIEStool version to HISTORY header of the output files, such that
  one can trace which version was used for the reduction of a particular
  file.


(21/07/09)

- Fixed a bug that was introduced in 1.3.1, that gave rise to program
  crashes when the FITS-based file dialogs tried to scan files that were
  non-FITS.

(16/06/09)

- More updates to the scattered light routine. Now tested with 3x2, 2x2 and
  1x1, including interlaced. Polynomial order for bg-fitting is now 10 in x,
  and 8 in y.

FIEStool-1.3.1
==============

(30/03/09)

- Updated routine for scattered light subtraction, such that more pixels
  between orders will be considered for background fitting. There is now
  also an additional debugging plot available to inspect the background fits.

(28/05/09)

- Also made FIEStool remember FITS header keywords when building the file dialogs.
  This makes the dialogs much faster (except the first time, obviously).


FIEStool-1.3.0
==============

(02/03/09)

- Fixed bugs in autoLoader:
    (1) Make it possible to test on header keywords that are not in the primary
        HDU, but in later HDUs.
    (2) Fixed problem with reading of autoLoader config file. Old definitions
	are now properly removed.

- Completely rewrote how scattered light is subtracted. A 2-d polynomial is now
  fitted to the background with numpy-based routines, and not with IRAF. This
  also includes an (optional) rough order-finding algorithm, such that it is
  possible to subtract the background before the user does interactive order
  finding. This allows FIEStool to correctly find all orders, and not just the
  ones that exceed the highest background threshold.

  The new background subtraction algorithm is also implemented in the normal
  processing of science frames. This method also works on low-resolution (2x2)
  spectra. The rewriting of the bg-subtraction is the primary reason to increae
  the release numbering to 1.3.0

  It is still possible to revert to the old subtraction method by modifying the
  boolean parameter 'newmethod' in the 'scattering' and 'findorders' tasks.


FIEStool-1.2.14
===============

(28/12/08)

- Added a new task 'updatethar' that will recalculate the wavelength solution if
  a ThAr frame is processed. Ready for in-depth testing.
  NB: this task is not yet part of the (default) user configuration file.
- Fixed that all taskbars are properly cleared/greyed when starting to process
  a new frame
- Made it possible to enter empty values as filename selections, so one can
  remove references that no longer exist from the config file.
- Allow value 0 to be entered for an integer.

(21/12/08)

- Improved extraction of interlaced ThAr by not recentering the orders
  and eliminating the 'clean' algorithm (ThAr only!).
- This improves the intra-night precision of RV measurements to 5 m/s,
  as long as the interlaced orders are properly defined, and have not
  too large widths.
- Added header with determined pixel shift

FIEStool-1.2.13 (unreleased)
============================

(17/12/08)

- Fixed an error in the threshold calculation for the combined flat field.
- Fixed problem of not being able to read autoloader configuration
  interactively.

(18/08/08)

Added functionality to extract and work with additional bands that include
estimates for the uncertainty. This is activated by modifying the apsum.par
configuration files such that uncertainties are extracted. The additional bands
are, however, not yet propagated to the merged spectra. (Note - extracting the
uncertainties is now the standard behavior).

(20/05/08)

FIEStool-1.2.12
===============

- Prepared a command-line version for batch scripting (not yet included in
  distributed version)

- Corrected small error when reading configuration files. The current reduction
  mode is now retained when a new file is read.
- Added filename to output when combining biases and flats
- Introduced automatic scrollbar to the main FIEStool window
- Changed behavior of order finding routine to 'recenter' on start
- Save a copy of the order definition when determining a new one
  (useful for quality control)
- Added 'interactive' variables to 'findord', 'findinterlacedord' and
  'wavecal' tasks. These can then be turned off when scripting from the command
  line.


FIEStool-1.2.11
===============

(21/03/08)

Added a few lines to make it possible to plot cross-order profiles other than
just the center row

In addition, updated the parameter settings for scattered light subtraction
(apscat1.par and apscat2.par) to better take into account the variable
background of the DoubleSpec mode. This removed small 2-3% deep depressions
in the continuum of hot stars.

(13/03/08)

Changed heliocentric header name from VHEL to VHELIO. This gives compatibility
with IRAF.


FIEStool-1.2.10
===============

(18/12/07)

Added functionality :

  - Imports and versions of numpy, pyfits, pyraf and biggles checked when
    starting FIEStool
  - Added line to dispcor.par file, so that also IRAF version 2.12.3-BETA will
    work

Updated :

  - Current reduction mode now properly maintained in the configuation parameter
  - Include a default autoloader configuration in the tarball distribution


FIEStool-1.2.9
==============

(01/12/07)

Several improvements :

  - FIEStool now read text-based configuration files
  - AutoLoader now has its own menu and save files
  - Config files have default suffix : 
    ".cfg"  for normal config files
    ".acfg" for autoloader config files
  - Framed for which the autoLoader aborts the reduction are no longer
    autoplotted (buxfix)
  - Filename filter entry in autoQueue is now a normal (configurable) options
  - Starting and ending wavelengths for plots are now also normal options
  - Tasks that run in threads give time for the GUI to update
  - The reduction modes and its corresponding tasks are controlled from the
    config file (and thus, controllable by the user)
  - Plotting the extracted spectra is now a real pipeline task
  - Non-FITS-file dialogs are now handled by tkFileDialog
  


FIEStool-1.2.5
==============

(25/11/07)

Added lots of bugfixes and features :

  - AutoScrollbar for configFrame and calibFrame
  - Added 'abort' feature to autoLoader
  - Removed the 'status bar' from the messageLog (users found it confusing)
  - Fixed behavior of LoadFITSfile, and put new default search pattern (*.fit*)
  - Increased maximum number of features for ec(re)identify from 100 to 1000
  - Improved scattered light subtraction (now with spline instead of 'stiff'
    legendre polynomial
  - Added an option to the autoLoader to stop further processing of a frame


FIEStool-1.2
============

(21/11/07)

Fixed a bug in the subtraction of scattered light. The parameters for the
auxilary tasks apscat1 and apscat2 were not set properly. A similar issue
existed for apfind.

Also removed the interactive query for number of orders in apfind.


(15/11/07)

The implemention of numpy showed that there is a difference in the behaviour
of the rough filter used to correct the instrumental blaze function. At the
frame edges, the convolution would pad the arrays with zeroes, thus forcing the blaze functions to zero value at the edge. This has been corrected by
inserting the original blaze function at the five outmost pixels (which is
where the edge effect appeared).

(25/10/07)

Corrected a 'bug' in the calculation of average biases and summed flats. The
frames are so large that the averaging should be done in double precision. This
was giving really big errors in the results (more than 100 ADUs). Numpy wasn't
smart enough to detect this or complain...

(01/08/07)

- Major change! Moved from numarray to numpy, since numarray support will be
  phased out soon by STScI.

  This involved changing the code in many places. Fortunately, numpy is very
  similar to numarray.

- Implemented a proper determination of the threshold for choosing
  pixel-to-pixel corrections vs smoothed FF functions.

- Decreased memory requirements for combining biases and flats. Instead of
  having a large datacube in-memory, frames are read from disk and processed
  immediately.
  
- Updated the error handling such that errors are handled better in threads


(20/12/2006)

- Added another change in the call to the PyRAF interactive windows (this time: splot).
- Changed all occurences of Float32 to Float64, to get higher wavelength precision.


FIEStool-1.1.1
==============

(14/09/2006)

Made some small changes to calls to PyRAF routines that use interactive windows (i.e. apfind and ecidentify), in order to avoid an unresponsive window on slow
displays.

FIEStool-1.1
============

(29/08/2006)

Minor updates only. Added some missing files to the distribution tarball
and fixed an error in the calculation of the size of binned frames. Also
added a new ThAr corresponding to the latest layout of FIES, with a larger
wavelength region.


FIEStool-1.0
============

(25/11/2005)

Version 1.0 released !

Lots of updates, including :

- Extended manual
- Included hyperrefs in manual
- Created web page


FIEStool-0.9.6.2
================

(23/11/2005)

- Renamed many tasks so that 'master' only refers to stable input data, in
  this case the 'master' wavelength definition. Also updated GUI elements and
  comments. Some old names still exist in the source code.

- Created a command line startup option that will allow access to the
  calibration frame (and no access as default). In this way one avoids that
  the user messes up the existing set of configuration frames.

- A lot of updates to the documentation

- Corrected a small bug in the AutoLoader related to restoring old AutoLoader
  rules when starting the program.


(17/11/2005)

- Created ThAr atlas based on FIES data.

- Recreated the screenshots included in the manual, reflecting
  a real configuration state on elena.

- Added command-line option "-c" or "--calib". Not giving this parameter
  will hide the calibration frame from the interface, so that the user will
  not accidentaly delete/overwrite existing reference data.

(15/11/2005)

- Changed flat field generation to summing instead of averaging

- Updated the routine to generate 3-dimensional datasets so that
  the data will remain in memory after closing the source FITS file
  (by using the .copy() method...)

- Changed the default output values in the rvcorrect.par file to zero,
  instead of some arbitrary (=confusing) number.

(10/11/2005)

- Commented last module - 'mainFrame' (was about time!)

- Extended manual with instructions on how to modify the software

- Moved Chebychev polynomial calculations from chebev.py into plotUtils.py
  and removed chebev.py (it was only one function anyway).

- Added full functionality for bad pixel mask processing. Bad pixels are set
  to zero. See also bias subtraction on how zero-valued pixels are treated.

- Moved software and documentation into CVS repository



FIEStool-0.9.6.1
================

(26/10/2005)

- Added option of using 'master' wavelength definition that will be used
  as a first guess when determining new wavelength solutions.



FIEStool-0.9.6
==============

(04/10/2005) ... A _lot_ of progess since last update. 

- Source code in 'tasks.py' is now fully commented.

- Added and modified routines in frameUtils in order to be able to process
  Multi-Extension FITS files
  
- Allow for flipping and rotation of input frames before processing.

- Debugged and rewritten wavelength and aperture definition file copying.

- Changed layout of the automatic plotting checkbox to a format similar to
  the task checkboxes.

- Split plotting button into 'Plot last spectrum' and 'Plot other spectrum'

- Tested FIEStool on MUSICOS data... Worked reasonably well.

- Logfiles are now really saved to disk.

- A continuously updated logfile is maintained during each session.


FIEStool-0.9.5.5
================

(13/04/2005)

- As noted on 06/04, the wavelength definition files get longer and longer,
  and eventually assigning wavelengths to frames breaks down. Added a new
  routine that will clean the IRAF database when extracting orders or
  assigning wavelengths.


(12/04/2005)

- Streamlined the software. Moved utility routines into different files.
  Experimented with putting the tasks into a subdirectory (as a package), but
  that does not make much sense if the tasks are making calls to routines
  in the main directory (such as messageLog).

- Investigated the possibility to use matplotlib for visualization, but
  rejected it again. Matplotlib has rather strong requirements on the system,
  and is much more difficult to install than Biggles. As long as there will
  be an IRAF-like plotting facility, the user can do more or less the same.

(08/04/2005)

- Check whether the recovered offsets from interlaced calibration lamp spectra
  make sense and have the correct sign.

(06/04/2005)

- Added a new reduction mode "DoubleSpec" to process interlaced calibration
  lamp spectra.  

- The wavelength definition files stored in the IRAF database is appended to
  for every new determination of a solution. If the number of solutions gets
  large, the is no longer possible to read these definition files. Is this
  a real problem? (YES)


FIEStool-0.9.5
==============

(15/03/2005)

- Did a lot of work on getting the correct blaze shape. For low S/N data in the
  blaze function, a fitted curve is used. One needs quite a high-order
  polynomial to fit this properly.
  
  Below 6000Å, blaze correction is still a bit off at the end of the spectral
  orders. This is only a real problem in frames with very high signals. As long
  as the level of exposure is similar as the flat-field, blaze correction works
  good. A 'hotter' and flatter flat-field is required.

(14/03/2005)

- Corrected small bug in the autoLoader

(08/03/2005)

- Made BIAS processing more efficient by concentrating calculations
  in numarray
  
- Reviewed FLAT normalization. 'fit1d'-method gives better result

(07/03/2005)

- Improved blaze shape determination and flat-fielding procedures

(28/02/2005 - 02/03/2005)

- Modified BIAS combining to use more Numarray, and reject any pixels that are
  more than 5 times the standard deviation (=RON) away from the mean.

- Plot histogram when calculating the master BIAS frame

- Changed plotting procedure to plot single spectra. Last modifications were
  a bit too hard on the code...

- Rewrote FLAT combining to subtract BIAS from each frame before averaging

- Moved creation of 3D dataset (for BIAS and FLAT combining) to a seperate
  routine in imageUtils

- Adjusted scattering parameters to a much more agressive curve fitting to the
  inter-order light.

- Found and corrected a bug in the scattered light fitting routine of
  'iraftasks.py'. Now different polynomials are used for along and across
  the dispersion direction.

FIEStool-0.9.4
==============

(24/02/2005)

- Plotting routine now takes wavelength ranges for wavelength calibrated
  spectra, and order numbers for spectra without any wavelength information.

- Reordered layout of plotting buttons.


FIEStool-0.9.3.5
================

(21/02/2005)

- Added order merging task

- Updated plotting routine to handle 1D spectra

- Trying to change plotting behavior to get hardcopy of plots.. Not finished
  Was rather difficult - removed again (22/02/2005)


FIEStool-0.9.3
==============

(17/02/2005)

- Made mode-specific task configuration possible

- Added rejection of bad pixels for 'Advanced' reduction

- Changed color of disabled fields to black instead of (almost) invisible grey


FIEStool-0.9.2
==============

(11/02/2005)

- Removed all interactive IRAF prompts when defining orders

- Added task to plot order locations

- Fixed handling of non-existent wavelength definitions

- Produce error messages when encountering incompatible frame sizes

- Cleaned up the list of task parameter files


FIEStool-0.9.1
==============

- Fixed compatibility issues. Now works on elena.


FIEStool-0.9
============

- Beta (alpha?) release.

- Didn't work on elena because of incompatibility issues between
  Python 2.2.2 and 2.1.
